                <p>
                    Materials Commons will help you to organize, track and publish your research.
                <p>

                <p>
                    It can be confusing learning a new system. We have guides to help you get started. To start
                    everything in Materials Commons is organized around
                    a project. The "CREATE PROJECT" button will guide you through setting up your first project
                    and using the system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are the type who prefers to start with documentation we've also included a link to our
                    Getting Started guide. Don't worry about dismissing this dialog, you can always get back to it by
                    clicking on the Help button. The help popup has a button titled "Welcome Dialog" that will bring
                    this dialog up.
