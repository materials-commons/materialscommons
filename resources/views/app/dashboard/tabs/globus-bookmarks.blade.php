    This page lists all the Materials Commons links to start a Globus upload/download for a project. If you bookmark
    this page in your browser then you can easily go to the Globus web page for your project.

    <b>Please note</b> that you
    cannot bookmark the Globus page as Materials Commons has to perform some setup in order to give Globus access
    to your project.
