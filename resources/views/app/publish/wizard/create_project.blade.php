                    It doesn't appear you have any projects. In Materials Commons all data is stored in a project. In
                    this
                    step you can give us the name of a project, and we will do all the setup. If you aren't sure what
                    name
                    to use then you can give it the same name you would for your published data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The steps after this will take you through uploading and publishing your data.

                    After you've created a project to store your data in you will be taken to the steps for creating
                    your dataset, uploading files, and publishing.
