        Everything in Materials Commons starts with a project. A project allows you to set up the list of collaborators
        you are sharing your files with. It's where you will create your studies, processes, samples, and publish
        your data from. You can set up many projects in Materials Commons, allowing you to separate who you share your
        data with.
